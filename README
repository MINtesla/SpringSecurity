JWT Security Implementation
Overview
In this update, we have integrated JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication into the project. JWT is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. It allows you to securely transmit information between parties as a JSON object, which can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed.

What is JWT?
JSON Web Tokens are used for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. They are signed using a cryptographic algorithm to ensure the integrity and authenticity of the data. JWTs are commonly used for authentication and authorization.

Testing
Ensure you test the JWT implementation thoroughly:

Test token generation and validation.
Verify that unauthorized requests are properly handled.
Ensure that JWT expiration and refresh mechanisms work as expected.
Future Enhancements
Token Refresh: Implement a refresh token mechanism to extend user sessions.
Additional Security: Explore additional security measures such as token blacklisting or revocation.
